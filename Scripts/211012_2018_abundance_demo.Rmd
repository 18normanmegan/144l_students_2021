# Goal

This document shows how **individual bottle** bacterial abundance data from 2018 remineralization experiments were processed, QC'd and analyzed. It also provides an intro to data processing and analysis with Rstudio and R Markdown. 

#Intro to R Markdown

Create a new code chunk: Mac - Cmd + option + i, PC - Ctrl + alt + i 

Load packages that we'll need to analyze our data. 
```{r Load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
```

We can toggle on/off warnings in chunks if we don't want them in our final markdown file. 

# Import Data

```{r}
excel_sheets("")
```
