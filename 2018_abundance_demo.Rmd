# Goal

This document shows how **individual bottle** bacterial abundance data from 2018 remineralization experiments were processed, QC'd and analyzed. It also provides an intro to data processing and analysis with RStudio and R Markdown.

# Intro to R Markdown
Create a new code chunk:
Shortcut to create a new code chunk: Ctrl + alt + i

Load packages we'll need to analyze our data:
```{r Load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
```

Using the settings button in a chunk, we can toggle on/off warnings or messages.

# Import data

```{r}
excel_sheets("Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx")

metadata <- read_excel("Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet = "Metadata")
```
